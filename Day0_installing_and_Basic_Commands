Installed git in windows and been accessing with powershell and registered name and email with the below commands

-- git config --global user.name "<name>"
-- git config --global user.email "email"

and to list all the output done
-- git --list

and to clone the repository
-- git clone <clone_link>

Once the repo got cloned to the local check the status of any files being not added like --git status
once cloned add a file to the repo by doing

git add <file> -- this will add the file to the local but nothing got commited yet (file will be in staging for now) and we need to commit the changes using
git commit -m <commit message>

once done, the file is commited to the local branch but need to be pushed to main branch or whatever branch we were looking into by doing
git push origin main (here orging refers to the github copy of our repository) and (main is the branch as default)
